            Mark Linkous

          (September 9, 1962 â€“ March 6, 2010) was an American singer, songwriter
          and musician, best known as leader of Sparklehorse. He was also known
          for his collaborations with such notable artists as Tom Waits, PJ
          Harvey, Daniel Johnston, Radiohead, Black Francis, Julian Casablancas,
          Nina Persson, David Lynch, Fennesz, Danger Mouse, and Sage Francis.

          A member of the 1980s indie band the Dancing Hoods, Linkous moved with
          the group from his native Virginia to New York City and later Los
          Angeles in hopes of achieving mainstream success. By 1988, the band
          had failed to land a major record label deal, and they disbanded with
          Linkous returning to Virginia, where he began writing songs under
          various monikers.
        </p>
        <p>
          By 1995, he created a project named Sparklehorse, of which he would
          remain the only permanent member. The band released a quartet of
          critically acclaimed albums on Capitol Records:
          Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot, Good Morning Spider, It's a
          Wonderful Life, and on Astralwerks records: Dreamt for Light Years in
          the Belly of a Mountain. Linkous lived the last years of his life in
          Hayesville, North Carolina, where he established Static King Studio.
          He committed suicide in Knoxville, Tennessee on March 6, 2010.

          Following the breakup of Dancing Hoods, Linkous moved back to
          Virginia, where he continued writing songs. One of the tracks that he
          wrote during this period with David Lowery, "Sick of Goodbyes", was
          recorded by Cracker and appeared on their 1993 album Kerosene Hat.
          While in Virginia, he performed concerts under the monikers The
          Johnson Family (with members of Richmond punk legends Honor Role) and
          Salt Chunk Mary. Linkous finally settled on the band name
          Sparklehorse, and released Vivadixiesubmarinetransmissionplot on
          Capitol Records in 1995. He remained the only consistent member
          throughout the band's existence.

          In 1996, while supporting Radiohead on the first Sparklehorse tour,
          Linkous overdosed on alcohol, Valium and antidepressants and possibly
          other substances in his London hotel room. Rendered unconscious by the
          combination of drugs, he collapsed with his legs pinned beneath him,
          and remained in that position for almost fourteen hours. He was
          treated at St Mary's Hospital, London. Subsequent surgeries saved both
          legs, but he required the use of a wheelchair for six months. His legs
          never fully regained their original strength.

        <p>
          1998 saw the release of Good Morning Spider; some of the album's songs
          dealt with Linkous' accident in London and subsequent rehabilitation,
          namely "St. Mary". In 2001, Sparklehorse released It's a Wonderful
          Life, which featured contributions from Tom Waits, PJ Harvey, John
          Parish, Nina Persson, Vic Chesnutt, and Dave Fridmann.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2003, Sparklehorse's song Sea of Teeth was featured on the All the
          Real Girls Soundtrack, a film starring Zooey Deschanel and directed by
          David Gordon Green.
        </p>
        <p>
          In September 2006, Sparklehorse released Dreamt for Light Years in the
          Belly of a Mountain.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2009 Linkous teamed up with electronic ambient artist Christian
          Fennesz to create In the Fishtank 15, an experimental EP. The last
          four live shows Linkous did together with Fennesz were during a
          European tour which was held in October 2009.

        <h2>Death</h2>
        <p>
          In March 2010, Linkous was in the process of moving into a spare
          bedroom in the Knoxville home of bandmate Scott Minor; Linkous was
          apparently in the process of breaking up with his wife of 19 years,
          Teresa. Linkous battled depression for many years, and was greatly
          shaken by the December 2009 suicide of close friend Vic Chesnutt.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the time of his death, his manager confirmed that Linkous "had
          completed most of the work for a new Sparklehorse album", was in the
          process of moving to Knoxville, Tennessee, and was working on setting
          up a studio where he planned to finish the record.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the early afternoon of March 6, 2010, Linkous was drinking Kentucky
          bourbon with Minor and friend DeWitt Burton at their home. After
          receiving a number of text messages on his BlackBerry that left him
          distraught, he told Minor and Burton, "It's not good." Linkous quietly
          retrieved his ITM Arms rifle from an upstairs room, then told his two
          friends that he was going for a walk and exited through a back door.
          At about 1:15pm, a witness saw him sit down in the alley near Irwin
          Street, aim the rifle at his own heart, and pull the trigger. Linkous
          was declared dead at the scene; he was 47 years old.
        </p>
        <p>
          Police did not find a suicide note. The musician's publicist confirmed
          the details of his death to a number of publications on the same day.
          According to his toxicology report, his blood alcohol content was 0.43
          at the time of his death; benzodiazepines and antidepressants were
          also found in his system.
        </p>
        <p>
          Teresa Linkous died six years later, on March 5, 2016, from an acute
          asthma attack.
